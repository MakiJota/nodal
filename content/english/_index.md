## Values

Equity is central to our work. We recognise the imbalance of power between those making decisions and those affected by them, and we seek to bridge this gap by advocating for residents and users of cities through evidence-based methods.

## Goals

In the first year, we aim to demonstrate value across three verticals: by building tools and simulations, by advising on strategies such as municipal GIS digitisation, and by enabling organisations through training and capacity-building. We will engage with municipalities, property owners, real estate developers, and universities, while actively positioning ourselves as a small and agile SME partner in Swedish and European research projects.

Our medium-term objective is to deepen our role within municipalities by developing recurring services. These may include pre-processed analysis layers for GIS data and platforms that help departments understand and utilise their information more effectively. 

Over the next five years, we will establish a base in Sweden and occasionally expand to projects in the UK. In the long term, we aspire to expand our impact internationally, starting with Argentina, Egypt, and India, where we can apply lessons learned in Sweden to new contexts.
