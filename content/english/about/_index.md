## Our Approach

We engage with stakeholders and, together, we co-create a pathway to analyze data and build dashboards that empower decision-makers. Our process is collaborative and inclusive, ensuring that every voice is heard and that solutions are tailored to real-world needs. By fostering a rich environment of data, we help stakeholders make informed decisions that drive meaningful change.

### Defining Goals and Targets with Data

Our process for defining goals and targets that can be solved with data is structured, transparent, and participatory:

1. **Stakeholder Discovery & Alignment**  
	We begin by meeting with all relevant stakeholders—municipalities, organizations, and community representatives—to understand their unique challenges, priorities, and aspirations. Through workshops and interviews, we surface the key questions and pain points that matter most.

2. **Goal Setting & Target Definition**  
	Together, we translate these challenges into clear, actionable goals. We help stakeholders articulate what success looks like, whether it’s improving accessibility, reducing energy costs, or increasing community engagement. We define measurable targets that are ambitious yet achievable.

3. **Data Audit & Opportunity Mapping**  
	We assess the available data sources, identify gaps, and map out opportunities for new data collection. This ensures that our approach is grounded in evidence and that we can track progress toward each target.

4. **Co-Designing Solutions**  
	With goals and data in hand, we co-design dashboards, simulations, and analytical tools that make complex information accessible and actionable. We iterate with stakeholders to ensure the solutions are user-friendly and truly meet their needs.

5. **Implementation & Capacity Building**  
	We support the rollout of these solutions, providing training and guidance so that stakeholders can confidently use the tools to inform their decisions. Our aim is to build lasting capacity within organizations.

6. **Monitoring, Evaluation & Adaptation**  
	Finally, we establish feedback loops to monitor outcomes, evaluate impact, and adapt strategies as needed. This ensures that goals remain relevant and that our work delivers real, measurable value over time.

By following this process, we help our partners move from broad ambitions to concrete, data-driven actions that create lasting positive change.
